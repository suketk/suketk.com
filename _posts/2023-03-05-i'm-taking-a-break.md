description: Giving myself some breathing room.
---

I’m deferring the Feb 2023 retrospective.

The last month was my most challenging one yet. There are certainly many valuable lessons I’ll draw from it, but at the moment I’m still recovering and processing the experience.

This decision is an example of one of those lessons: stick to your commitments when you can, but give yourself breathing room when you need it. The pressure to publish was adding undue stress, so I’m pausing it until further notice.

You’ll hear from me soon when I’m in a better place to share!
