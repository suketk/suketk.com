Overcoming an obstacle is like pushing a boulder over a hill. It’s not going to happen by itself - it requires a concerted effort.

But effort alone isn’t enough. Quality and quantity matters too. Push the boulder in the wrong direction and you don’t achieve your goal. Push it too softly and it rolls back to where you started. You have to cross a threshold of activation energy to get it to the other side.

That is the nature of obstacles. The effort comes first; the payoff later. Until you reach the activation energy, your effort is in vain.

The next time you contemplate giving up, remember this. It’s all or nothing - there is no halfway. The problem isn’t going to resolve itself, so the only way out is *through*.
