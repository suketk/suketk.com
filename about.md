Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here, I share my musings on how to craft an intentional life (how I deliberate on how to be deliberate?). It serves two purposes: to refine my own thoughts through writing and *hopefully* encourage others to lead an examined life.

### The Genesis

This blog has familiar origins. Comfortable childhood. Good grades in school. Lucrative job in Tech. *"Why am I not as happy as people say I should be?"* [Quit]({{site.url}}/why-i-quit-google) to *find yourself*. And... here we are.

The plan was simple. Work hard. Save a lot of money. Retire early. Enjoy the reward: living my life! But, I had no idea what that meant and no time to figure it out - my life was taking place in the scraps of time that work spared.

Sensing a regret in the making, I set out on a journey to reverse this; to fit work around my life. This is the first step - laying the foundation for a set of principles for an intentional life.

### What I'm Up To

At the moment, I have two priorities:

1. Building [**Habit Gym**](https://www.thehabitgym.com) to help others craft a meaningful life
1. Sharing my thoughts here every week

Though the two sound unrelated, they perfectly complement each other. The blog exposes you to new ideas and Habit Gym helps you apply them.

In fact, Habit Gym was born out of the lessons from my own journey to live an intentional life - the theme of this blog.
