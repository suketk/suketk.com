Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here, I share my musings on how to craft an intentional life (how I deliberate on how to be deliberate?). It serves two purposes: to refine my own thoughts through writing and *hopefully* encourage others to lead an examined life.

This blog has familiar origins. Comfortable childhood. Good grades in school. Lucrative job in Tech. *"Why am I not as happy as people say I should be?"* Quit to *find yourself*. And... here we are.

The plan was simple. Work hard. Save a lot of money. Retire early. Enjoy the reward: living my life! But, I had no idea what that meant and no time to figure it out - my life was taking place in the scraps of time that work spared. Sensing a regret in the making, I set out on a journey to reverse this; to fit work around my life. This is the first step - laying the foundation for a set of principles for an intentional life.
